\usage{
world_redefine(template, name, type = "Raster", typepars,
  overwrite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{template}{Template file used to generate redefine worldfile for RHESSys. Use "-9999" to retain
values of exisintg worldfile. Generic strucutre is:
<state variable> <operator> <value/map>. Levels are difined by lines led by "_", structured
<levelname> <map> <count>. Whitespace and tabs are ignored.  Maps referred to must be supplied
by your chosen method of data input(GRASS or raster), set using the "type" arguement.}

\item{type}{Input file type to be used. Default is raster. "Raster" type will use rasters
in GeoTiff or equivalent format (see Raster package), with file names  matching those indicated in the template.
ASCII is supported, but 0's cannot be used as values for data. "GRASS" will attempt to autodetect the version of
GRASS GIS being used (6.x or 7.x).  GRASS GIS type can also be set explicitly to "GRASS6" or "GRASS7".}

\item{typepars}{Parameters needed based on input data type used. If using raster type, typepars should be a string
indicating the path to a folder containing the raster files that are referenced by the template.
For GRASS GIS type, typepars is a vector of 5 character strings. GRASS GIS parameters: gisBase, home, gisDbase, location, mapset.
Example parameters are included in an example script included in this package. See initGRASS help
for more info on parameters.}

\item{overwrite}{Overwrite existing redefine worldfile. FALSE is default and prompts a menu if worldfile already exists.}

\item{worldfile}{Name and path of redefine worldfile to be created.}
}
\description{
Generates redefine worldfiles for use in RHESSys specifically to modify exisitng worldfile values via
replacing values or multipliers.
Currently includes functionality for GRASS GIS (depreciated) and raster data, and works on both unix and windows. 3/4/19.
